# FastAPI Hangman Game

Welcome to the FastAPI Hangman Game! This project provides an interactive Hangman game API built using the FastAPI framework.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the Hangman game API.

## API Endpoints

- **GET `/`**: Returns a welcome message.

- **POST `/start`**: Starts a new Hangman game and provides the length of the word to guess.

- **POST `/guess/{word}/{guessed_letters}`**: Make a guess in the Hangman game. Replace `{word}` with the target word, and `{guessed_letters}` with the guessed letters so far. Provide the letter you want to guess in the request body.

## Usage

1. Access the welcome message by visiting the root URL: `http://localhost:8000/`.

2. Start a new game by making a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/start`.

3. Make guesses in the game by making POST requests to `http://localhost:8000/guess/{word}/{guessed_letters}`.
   - Replace `{word}` with the target word and `{guessed_letters}` with the guessed letters so far.
   - Include the letter you want to guess in the request body.

4. The game will respond with messages indicating the result of the guess and the updated guessed letters.

5. Continue making guesses until you win the game or run out of attempts.
